        <p class="q">What did lee even make?</p>
        <pre class="a">
I honestly wanted to make something for you after you drew me that picture (during feb) which I still use as my wallpaper,
so I thought I will make a silly website with maybe some random fun games and shit.
but at that time I didnt know how to make anything and yea...the journey officially began. I started watching tutorials, taking notes 
and making plans, I was very excited to reveal it to you, "omg shes gonna love it", prolly appreciate it alot and blablabla lol.

      <div class="qa">
        <p class="q">why in your birthday?</p>
        <pre class="a">
At first I just simply wanted to show you this but it was taking me alot of time learn everything.
so I decided to set a deadline so I can learn faster and give it to you as a gift, so thats why I selected your birthday.
it would make it special and kinda funny too. "haha lee made a weirdass game for me on my bday"  😂😂 is what I was thinking.
I had around 5 months to learn everything and prepare this for you, so yea your birthday seemed perfect... until... mf came around 💀

      <div class="qa">
        <p class="q">huh how is this connected to mf?</p>
        <pre class="a">
well after that incident happened...I started wondering if you cant even appreciate me yapping in a server for one hour just so
I could speak with yall a little, then will you even grasp the length I went out to make this website? I started doubting it... 
does this even matter? asmaa if I learned anything in my life, it is that efforts at the wrong time always costs alot..
specially emotionally, but by that time I was already halfway there..quitting that time would be unfair...I could never be able 
to show you what I was trying to make for you... but I stopped.

and that was creeping me out, and eventually I couldnt control it and thats why I crashed out for the mf incident...I started questioning
my worth here.. I dont give a fuck I couldnt speak that day, what I gave a fuck about was the unnoticed effort..it was scaring me, 
I didnt wanna put so much effort in somethingwhich might go unnoticed by you.</pre

      <div class="qa">
        <p class="q">so why did I continue?</p>
        <pre class="a">
coz then you  said sorry...idk something in me still wanted to keep going, you understood what you did and that filled my confidence up 
again. yea its okay she didnt realised at first but she noticed it later and the more I texted you the more I wanted to make it, 
yes..basically you reclaimed yourself 😝😝. lucky bish..all this effort was about to go to waste...

anyhow but this time I didnt wanted a silly lil game anymore, I wanted to show you how much I cared about this friendship, 
the journey we had, the moemnts we went through, the fun and sad times...everything...so yep, the concept of the whole website changed.

      <div class="qa">
        <p class="q">so what does the contents of the website mean?</p>
        <pre class="a">
the poem was meant to show that I noticed your life, the hardships you went through and are going through, and I wanted you to wish you 
to do the best in life, I always liked to write poems with deep meanings, so this was the best way to represent it to you. but writing 
it was pain istg lol, I felt like I was stalking you life lmaoo.... mhm sorry if it feels too much but I had to do it 😭😭

lol fun fact it has alot of deep meanings btw, 
"waxing crescent moon" is the exact shape of moon on your birthday -- 31 july 2006, on your location (tripoli i assume).
everything you see in the poem was well thought out, "stop beating around the bush" meant stop talking with ali.
some more are there but I cant remember while typing this..so you can ask lee for more hidden meanings.

the memories page was meant to show that I care about everything that we went through..from the start, you already know I love collecting
and storing memories... and ofcourse I value them alot, I described each memory and even looked for the exact time and date..
 stalking pro max 💀💀 

and lastly the minigame was actually the thing that I wanted to make first lol, ik its very small but I was focussing too much on the 
other things for obvious reasons....</pre

        <pre class="a">
Thank you very much for allowing me to make something like this, I absolutely loved making this and loved every moment working on it.
I finally have a skill that I can brag about too, and your officially welcome to my first ever project that i ever worked on this long, 
I usually quit after like 2 weeks but this is the longest I ever stuck on making something and I think i finally found
my passion as well... coding is life and life is coding. 😛😛
