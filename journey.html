        <br />
      </p>
      <div class="qa">
        <p class="q">What did lee even make?</p>
        <p class="a">
          I honestly wanted to make something for you after you drew me that
          picture (during feb) which I still use as my wallpaper, <br />
          so I thought I will make a silly website with maybe some random fun
          games and shit. <br />
          but at that time I didnt know how to make anything and yea...the
          journey officially began. I started watching tutorials, taking notes
          <br />
          and making plans, I was very excited to reveal it to you, "omg shes
          gonna love it", prolly appreciate it alot and blablabla lol. <br />
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="qa">
        <p class="q">why in your birthday?</p>
        <p class="a">
          At first I just simply wanted to show you this but it was taking me
          alot of time to learn everything. <br />
          so I decided to set a deadline so I can learn faster and give it to
          you as a gift, so thats why I selected your birthday. <br />
          it would make it special and kinda funny too. "haha lee made a
          weirdass game for me on my bday" üòÇüòÇ is what I was thinking. <br />
          I had around 5 months to learn everything and prepare this for you, so
          yea your birthday seemed perfect... until... mf came around üíÄ <br />
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="qa">
        <p class="q">huh how is this connected to mf?</p>
        <p class="a">
          well after that incident happened...I started wondering if you cant
          even appreciate me yapping in a server for one hour just so <br />
          I could speak with yall a little, then will you even grasp the length
          I went out to make this website? I started doubting it... <br />
          does this even matter? asmaa if I learned anything in my life, it is
          that efforts at the wrong time always costs alot.. <br />
          specially emotionally, but by that time I was already halfway
          there..quitting that time would be unfair...I could never be able
          <br />
          to show you what I was trying to make for you... but I stopped. <br />
          <br />
          and that was creeping me out, and eventually I couldnt control it and
          thats why I crashed out for the mf incident...I started questioning
          <br />
          my worth here.. I dont give a fuck I couldnt speak that day, what I
          gave a fuck about was the unnoticed effort..it was scaring me, <br />
          I didnt wanna put so much effort in something which might go unnoticed
          by you. <br />
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="qa">
        <p class="q">so why did I continue?</p>
        <pbr class="a">
          coz then you said sorry...idk something in me still wanted to keep
          going, you understood what you did and that filled my confidence up
          <br />
          again. yea its okay she didnt realised at first but she noticed it
          later and the more I texted you the more I wanted to make it, <br />
          yes..basically you reclaimed yourself üòùüòù. lucky bish..all this
          effort was about to go to waste... <br />
          <br />
          anyhow but this time I didnt wanted a silly lil game anymore, I wanted
          to show you how much I cared about this friendship, <br />
          the journey we had, the moments we went through, the fun and sad
          times...everything...so yep, the concept of the whole website changed.
          <br />
        </pbr>
      </div>

      <div class="qa">
        <p class="q">so what does the contents of the website mean?</p>
        <p class="a">
          the poem was meant to show that I noticed your life, the hardships you
          went through and are going through, and I wanted you to wish you
          <br />
          to do the best in life, I always liked to write poems with deep
          meanings, so this was the best way to represent it to you. but writing
          <br />
          it was pain istg lol, I felt like I was stalking you life lmaoo....
          mhm sorry if it feels too much but I had to do it üò≠üò≠ <br />
          <br />
          lol fun fact it has alot of deep meanings btw, <br />
          "waxing crescent moon" is the exact shape of moon on your birthday --
          31 july 2006, on your location (tripoli i assume). <br />
          everything you see in the poem was well thought out, "stop beating
          around the bush" meant stop talking with ali. <br />
          some more are there but I cant remember while typing this..so you can
          ask lee for more hidden meanings. <br />
          <br />
          the memories page was meant to show that I care about everything that
          we went through..from the start, you already know I love collecting
          <br />
          and storing memories... and ofcourse I value them alot, I described
          each memory and even looked for the exact time and date.. <br />
          stalking pro max üíÄüíÄ <br />
          <br />
          and lastly the minigame was actually the thing that I wanted to make
          first lol, ik its very small but I was focussing too much on the
          <br />
          other things for obvious reasons.... <br />
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="qa">
        <p class="q">conclusion</p>
        <p class="a">
          Thank you very much for allowing me to make something like this, I
          absolutely loved making this and loved every moment working on it.
          <br />
          I finally have a skill that I can brag about too, and your officially
          welcome to my first ever project that i ever worked on this long,
          <br />
          I usually quit after like 2 weeks but this is the longest I ever stuck
          on making something and I think i finally found <br />
          my passion as well... coding is life and life is coding. üòõüòõ <br />

          if your intrested in seeing the "behind the scenes" of what are the
          things I did and what I learned about and went through... <br />
          I can make a whole video about it or we can just be in a vc sometime
          and I will show it to you. <br />
          one last time... happy birthday to you and I am glad to be a part of
          it. üòõ <br />

          I absolutely enjoyed making this with all my heart. I learned alot of
          <br />
          things, not only just coding, but freaking life lessons and alot alot
          more. <br />
          <br />
          I wouldnt have said all this to be honest but I thought you needed
          <br />
          to know them or else some mysteries wont be solved. but I promise you,
          <br />
          these are the thoughts of mine before MONTHS. I already healed and I
          am <br />
          completely fine now. and let me also make it clear that you MUST NOT
          feel <br />
          guilty about any of this. it was no ones fault. not you, not mf, not
          even me. <br />
          <br />
          I promise you, you are the best person I ever met and the bestest
          <br />
          friend I ever made, this all was possible just because of you. It was
          just <br />
          wrong timing and wrong mindset which I already worked upon and I am<br />
          officially free from it.<br />
          <br />
          I hope you have the absolute best birthday everrr.<br />
