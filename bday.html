Once under a waxing crescent moon
comes out a sweet girl from its cucoon
as she starts to illume 
her owners starts to fume

yellings and beatings are all she sees
her heart screams "can we stop please"
through the chaos, comes her little sister 
maybe this is a plot twister? 

No it wasnt... not even close
infact it got even worse 
the yellings kept getting cray cray
I guess theres no hope for them to stay

finally one step left for her teenage
however, they couldnt stop the rage
well, the volcano finally erupts
their relatioship officially corrupts

Father? Mother? where does she go? 
while they are busy with their ego.
she learns to carry herself physically
but whose gonna carry the emotions mentally? 

Learns how to cook, learns how to clean
but she just wants to be seen
Finally, someone sees her !
but she couldnt see him with her 

oh what a misarable day
please babygirl... dont go away

well, mom gets another dad
bruh please stop making her sad
dude thinks its just his wife
bitchass what about the girls life?

she starts to see, she starts to feel
looks like nobody is there to kneel
but she cant just start to heal
cant just shoo it like a wheel
still she says no big deal

oh what a misarable day
please babygirl... dont go away

well I guess its time for uni
by now she knows why everyones a puny 
looking for someone to push
stop beating around the bush

she starts to see more of them with psychology
but babygirl, you also deserve an apology
you dont deserve this for their stupidity
pick yourself up from this toxicity

its okay, the world is very unfair
but we still have to care
all you can do is just share
and take breath of air 

oh what a misarable day
please babygirl... dont go away

Welcone to nineteen
you made it far lil queen
stop feeling unseen
we can see you through the screen 

oh what a happy day
please babygirl... dont go away

you dont have to keep feeling them anymore
we are here to see your part of lore
you dont have too suffer anymore
lets forget what happened before 

lets write a new story
a little corny but with more glory
Dont worry, I am here to carry
lets continue this journey 
pretty little lady.
